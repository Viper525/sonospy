[WMP Translators]
# Translations to be applied for UPnP servers specified after the equals in -w command
# line option
#
# WMP is the reference (do not change)
# Supported types are:
#    Through - Sonos WMP searches are passed through unadjusted to the proxied server
#              (will only work with fully WMP compliant servers - these will show up
#              on the Sonos controller anyway so it is only useful for testing)
#    Translate - WMP containers are translated to those specified for the UPnP server
#                (only 3 containers are actually used by Sonos for WMP)
#    Cache - WMP containers are translated, plus UPnP server returns are cached for
#            further WMP searches to translate into UPnP server searches.
#            Second parameter shows whether container is discrete or needs
#            search criteria applying subsequently
#    Browse - Sonos WMP searches are translated into UPnP server browses - NOTE, NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED

[Asset Containers]
# Containers that Asset uses for WMP container names
# Note that mapping the wrong containers may allow alternate containers to be
# searched, but equally they may not work correctly
# Note - for Asset to work with Sonos like this, Asset needs some removals from
#        its browse tree.
#
#        Browse tree that works:
#           Artist (No track listing)
#               Album (Display all)
#           Contributing Artist (No track listing)
#               Album (Display all)

#                   Album (Display all)
#           Title (Display all)
#           Playlist not set (needs registered version)
#
# It is likely that your Asset installation will use some container IDs that
# are different to the ones below (esp Contributing Artists as that is not in
# the standard Asset browse tree and you will have to add it)
#
# It is also likely that you will have to rescan your library in Asset to
# activate the above changes

#====================================================================

[index entry extras]

# This section allows setting of characters to be displayed around
# extra fields added to index entries. The extra fields themselves
# are defined in the simple sort orders section. You can add extra
# fields before (prefix) and/or after (suffix) an entry. Extra fields
# are displayed as:
#
#     PREFIX entry SUFFIX
#
# You can specify a prefix before an index entry, for example 
# playcount. You can specify the characters that you want to display
# around the prefix. If you want to include spaces in the characters,
# enclose the characters in single quotes. The 
# entry_prefix_start_separator characters will be displayed before 
# the prefix, and the entry_prefix_end_separator will be displayed
# after the prefix (and so between the prefix and the entry). If
# you do not want a separator, leave it empty. The prefix will be
# displayed as:
#
#     START_SEPARATOR prefix END_SEPARATOR

entry_prefix_start_separator=
entry_prefix_end_separator=' • '

# You can specify a suffix after an entry. The same rules apply as
# for a prefix, but note that in this case the start character will
# be between the suffix and the entry and the end character will be
# at the end of the line.

entry_suffix_start_separator=' • '
entry_suffix_end_separator=

# When a prefix or a suffix is displayed with an entry, it is 
# possible that the prefix/suffix will be blank due to empty tag
# data. If you want a specific character or characters to be
# displayed instead of nothing, specify them in the entry_extras_empty
# key:

entry_extras_empty=?

# When you specify a date to be displayed as a prefix or a suffix,
# you may want to control the format used to display the date. Do that with
# the entry_extras_date_format key.
# 
# entry_extras_date_format accepts as its argument a string that may and
# should include legal Python date format codes.
#
# For example, assuming a file tagged with a date of 1st February 2011, then:
#
# entry_extras_date_format=%Y       results in 2011
# entry_extras_date_format=%d/%m/%y results in 01/02/11
#
# See
# http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
# for more information.

[index section headers]

# This section allows control of heading entries displayed before
# sections displayed in an index. The sections themselves are
# defined in the advanced sort orders section.

# If you want to display section headers when sections are 
# displayed in an index, set show_section_header to Y:

show_section_header=Y

# If you want to suppress section headers when only a single
# entry is displayed in an index, set show_section_header_on_single
# to N

show_section_header_on_single=N

# If you want to suppress section headers when there are no entries
# found for a section, set show_section_header_when_empty to N

show_section_header_when_empty=N

# If you want to show only one section when the same single entry is
# found for all sections within an index, set
# hide_sections_for_single_entry to Y

# TODO: this key is not supported yet
hide_sections_for_single_entry=Y

# You can specify the characters displayed before and after a section
# header by setting section_header_prefix and/or section_header_suffix

display_virtuals_in_artist_index=Y
display_virtuals_in_contributingartist_index=Y
display_virtuals_in_composer_index=Y

#====================================================================

[works]

# Works are albums that you define yourself in .sp files.
# You can control which indexes works are displayed in. To do so set
# the following keys to Y or N

display_works_in_album_index=Y
display_works_in_artist_index=Y
display_works_in_contributingartist_index=Y
display_works_in_composer_index=Y

#====================================================================

[sort index]

# You can control whether alternate sort orders are enabled in the
# indexes in the controllers
#
# allowable settings are:
#
#    none       - alternate sort orders are not enabled
#
#    simple     - simple alternate sort orders are enabled
#                 (the sort order keys must be specified in the 
#                 simple sort orders section of this ini file)
#
#    advanced   - advanced alternate sort orders are enabled
#                 (the sort order keys must be specified in the 
#                 advanced sort orders section of this ini file)

alternative_index_sorting=simple

#====================================================================

# ==================
# SIMPLE SORT ORDERS
# ==================
#
# Alternate sort order in indexes can be specified for each index. 
# The following names are used to specify the available indices:
#
#   +--ARTISTS
#   |  |
#   |  +--ARTIST_ALBUMS
#   |
#   +--CONTRIBUTINGARTISTS
#   |  |
#   |  +--CONTRIBUTINGARTIST_ALBUMS
#   |
#   +--ALBUMS
#   |
#   +--COMPOSERS
#   |  |
#   |  +--COMPOSER_ALBUMS
#   |
#   +--GENRES
#   |  |
#   |  +--GENRE_ARTISTS
#   |     |
#   |     +--GENRE_ARTIST_ALBUMS
#   |
#   +--TRACKS
#   |
#   +--PLAYLISTS
#
# To create a sort order entry for an index, create a block with
# the name of the index followed by 'sort index'. Then create a key
# of sort_order with a value of the desired sort order. For example:
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index]
#     sort_order=year
#
# will cause your album index entries to be sorted on year rather
# than the default of album name.
#
# The available sort orders for each of the indexes are:
#
#     ARTISTS - artist, artistsort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         ARTIST_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, created, 
#                         lastmodified, lastplayed, playcount, albumtype
#
#     CONTRIBUTINGARTISTS - artist, artistsort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         CONTRIBUTINGARTIST_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, 
#                                     created, lastmodified, lastplayed, 
#                                     playcount, albumtype
#
#     ALBUMS - album, albumsort, artist, composer, year, inserted, created, 
#              lastmodified, lastplayed, playcount, albumtype
#
#     COMPOSERS - composer, composersort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         COMPOSER_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, created, 
#                           lastmodified, lastplayed, playcount, albumtype
#
#     GENRES - genre, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         GENRE_ARTISTS - artist, artistsort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#             GENRE_ARTIST_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, 
#                                   created, lastmodified, lastplayed, 
#                                   playcount, albumtype
#
#     TRACKS - title, titlesort, artist, album, genre, tracknumber, year, 
#              composer, codec, length, size, created, path, filename, 
#              discnumber, bitrate, samplerate, bitspersample, channels, 
#              lastmodified, inserted, lastplayed, playcount
#
#     PLAYLISTS - playlist, plfile, inserted, created, 
#                 lastmodified
#
# Each sort_order entry can be followed by asc or desc to denote
# an ascending (default) or descending sort order. Multiple fields
# can also be specified for a sort order, so that the order will
# be determined by the first field, followed by the second etc.
# If you specify multiple fields, separate them with a comma, for
# example:
#
#     sort_order=playcount,lastplayed
#
#
# DISPLAY NAMES
# =============
# You can also specify fields to prefix and suffix an index entry
# in the display. These fields will be displayed for each entry in
# the index, with the values gathered from the tags for that entry.
# To prefix an index entry use a key of entry_prefix with a value 
# of a tag available for that entry. For example to prefix entries
# in the album index with year, use:
#
#     entry_prefix=year
#
# Similarly to suffix an entry with playcount, use:
#
#     entry_suffix=playcount
#
# Available prefixes and suffixes for each index are:
#
#     ARTISTS - artist, artistsort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         ARTIST_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, created, 
#                         lastmodified, lastplayed, playcount, albumtype
#
#     CONTRIBUTINGARTISTS - artist, artistsort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         CONTRIBUTINGARTIST_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, 
#                                     created, lastmodified, lastplayed, 
#                                     playcount, albumtype
#
#     ALBUMS - album, albumsort, artist, composer, year, inserted, created, 
#              lastmodified, lastplayed, playcount, albumtype
#
#     COMPOSERS - composer, composersort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         COMPOSER_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, created, 
#                           lastmodified, lastplayed, playcount, albumtype
#
#     GENRES - genre, lastplayed, playcount
#
#         GENRE_ARTISTS - artist, artistsort, lastplayed, playcount
#
#             GENRE_ARTIST_ALBUMS - album, albumsort, year, inserted, 
#                                   created, lastmodified, lastplayed, 
#                                   playcount, albumtype
#
#     TRACKS - title, titlesort, artist, album, genre, tracknumber, year, 
#              composer, codec, length, size, created, path, filename, 
#              discnumber, bitrate, samplerate, bitspersample, channels, 
#              lastmodified, inserted, lastplayed, playcount
#
#     PLAYLISTS - playlist, plfile, inserted, created, 
#                 lastmodified
#
#
# PROXY SORT ORDERS
# =================
# You can also specify different sort orders for different proxies.
# To do so use the proxyname key. To make a sort order applicable to
# all proxies use a value of ALL (default). So to make a sort order
# section applicable to all proxies use:
#
#     proxyname=ALL
#
# whilst to make one applicable to just the proxy called 'Recent' use:
#
#     proxyname=Recent
#
#
# CONTROLLER SORT ORDERS
# ======================
# You can also specify different sort orders for different controllers.
# To do so use the controller key. To make a sort order applicable to
# all controllers use a value of ALL (default). So to make a sort order
# section applicable to all controllers use:
#
#     controller=ALL
#
# whilst to make one applicable to just the PC desktop controller use:
#
#     controller=PCDCR
#
# Allowable controller entries are:
#
#     PCDCR
#     MACDCR
#     CR100
#     CR200
#     ACR
#     iPhone
#     iPod touch
#     Sonospy
#
# SORT ORDER ACTIVATION
# =====================
# To deactivate a sort order set the active key to something other than
# Y (default), for example:
#
#     active=N
#

[ALBUMS sort index]
controller=PCDCR
entry_suffix=artist

[ARTIST_ALBUMS sort index]
controller=PCDCR
sort_order=year
entry_suffix=year

[ARTIST_ALBUMS sort index]
sort_order=created desc
entry_suffix=playcount

[CONTRIBUTINGARTIST_ALBUMS sort index]
sort_order=created desc
entry_suffix=playcount

#====================================================================

# ====================
# ADVANCED SORT ORDERS
# ====================
#
# Multiple sort orders can be specified for an index, resulting in multiple
# sections in that index. For example you could choose to display the entries
# in the ARTIST_ALBUMS index in both album and year orders. To do that you 
# need to create duplicate sort index section blocks for the index you want
# to do it for.
#
# To create sort order section entries for an index, create blocks with
# the name of the index followed by 'sort index section'. Then create keys
# of sort_order with values of the desired sort orders. For example:
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=album
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=year
#
# Note that sort index section blocks override any sort index blocks for the
# same index specified elsewhere in this file for simple sorts. So if you
# have:
#
#     [ALBUM sort index]
#     sort_order=album
#
#     [ALBUM sort index section]
#     sort_order=year
#
# then the section block will take precedence and the album index will be
# sorted on year.
#
# Note also that when alternative_index_sorting=advanced is set, simple
# sort ordering is also enabled so simple blocks that are not overriden
# with advanced ones will also be active.
#
# You can control the order of display of sections in an index using the
# section_sequence key. For example to reorder the above example you could
# use:
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=album
#     section_sequence=2
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=year
#     section_sequence=1
#
# You can specify different keys for each index section, causing them to be
# displayed differently. For example:
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=album
#     section_sequence=2
#     entry_suffix=playcount
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=year
#     section_sequence=1
#     entry_suffix=year
#
# You can filter album types in a section, so that any combination of albums,
# virtuals and works are displayed in a section. To do that use the 
# section_albumtype key ('ALL' is the default). For example:
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=album
#     section_albumtype=virtual
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=year
#
# Note that though you specify album, virtual or work as section_albumtype,
# if you want to sort on virtual or work title you specify the sort_order
# as album (as virtuals and works are treated as albums).
#
# You can specify a list of entries in section_albumtype separated with
# commas, for example:
#
#     [ALBUMS sort index section]
#     sort_order=album
#     section_albumtype=virtual,work
#
# When you add sections to indexes, display of headings for those sections is
# controlled by the [section headers] keys:
#
#     [section headers]
#     show_section_header=Y
#     show_section_header_on_single=N
#     show_section_header_when_empty=N
#     hide_sections_for_single_entry=Y
#     section_header_delimiter=------
#
# By default the headings are created by combining 'ordered by' with the
# sort_order for that section. You can change the default heading by using
# the section_name key, for example:
#
#     section_name=Year order
#

[COMPOSER_ALBUMS sort index section]

# Descriptions of the available key/value pairs are given within each block.

[SMAPI user indexes]
# It is possible to create user defined indexes and their entries here.
# This allows you to have multiple paths down any hierarchy. Once you
# create a user defined index here, you can refer to it in the hierarchies
# in [SMAPI root], and define some details for it in 
# [SMAPI user-defined-index sort index] (note you can only use the special 
# @ character to refer to the data from the parent entry when defining
# prefixes and suffixes for this type of index). As you can create multiple
# paths down the hierarchy, you are also able to refer to each of those
# paths in multiple [SMAPI index n sort index] entries to set different sort
# orders, prefixes etc.
# The format to define a user defined index is:
#     index-name=index-entry1,index-entry2,...

# It is possible to define the indexes that appear under the root of the
# SMAPI interface. You must also define the indexes in the rest of the
# hierarchies down to leaf level. The key will be used as the entry in
# the root of the service. The values are the indexes in the hierarchy -
# these must be valid fields from track tags separated by forward slashes,
# or user defined indexes.
# The final entry in each hierarchy must be the track entry.
# All root entries except for user defined indexes will also result in a
# search entry of the same name.
# The format of a root hierarchy is:
#     root-index-name=hierarchy-index1/hierarchy-index2/..../track

[SMAPI user search]
# You can specify search entries that search across multiple indexes
# at the same time. The key is the text that you want displayed in the
# search entries list, the value is a comma separated list of root level
# index names. Note that you cannot specify user defined indexes in the
# index list, and that it is not really sensible to combine textual and
# date formats in the same search.
Album/Artist/Track=Albums,Artists,Tracks
# You can also specify search entries that search across non root indexes.
# The key is the text that you want displayed in the search entries list,
# the value is the root index name followed by the sub-index of that root
# entry that you want to search (separated by a forward slash).

[SMAPI formats]
# You can specify the output format of dates using standard Python date
# syntax here:
smapi_date_format=%Y/%m/%d

[SMAPI sort]
# By default index hierarchies sort on the index field, you can turn on
# sorting on alternate fields and other special criteria here:
smapi_alternative_index_sorting=Y

# [SMAPI root-name/index-field sort index]
# If you have enabled alternate sort indexing, you can specify criteria
# for individual hierarchy/index entries as separate
# [SMAPI root-name/index-field sort index] blocks. To create a block
# replace root-name with a [SMAPI root] key, and index-field with the 
# name of an index from the corresponding values for that key.
# Note - if an index-field has a user defined index above it, you
# can refer to individual entries in the user defined index by placing
# the number of the entry after the index-field (separated by a space).
# Note 2 - to refer to the field immediately above a user defined field
# in the hierarchy use the special character @ (at sign). 
# For indexes based on track tags, the following keys can be set:
#     smapiname     - to set which service the entries relate to
#     controller    - to set which controllers the entries relate to
#     sort_order    - to set which fields are used in the order by clause
#     entry_prefix  - to set which tags to display before the title
#     entry_suffix  - to set which tags to display after the title
#     index_range   - to set the range of titles to display
#     range_field   - to set the field that an index range applies to (if
#                     you do not set the range field it defaults to the
#                     index field)
# For user defined indexes, only the following keys are applicable:
#     smapiname
#     controller
#     entry_prefix  - this can only be empty or @
#     entry_suffix  - this can only be empty or @
#
# If you specify an index_range, you must use the following syntax:
#
#     start to end              start match to end match in tag data type
#
#     first n records           number of records in sort order from beginning
#     last n records            number of records in sort order from end
#
#     last n days               number of days before today
#     last n weeks              number of weeks before today
#     last n months             number of months before today
#     last n years              number of years before today
#
#     n days to n+1 days        number of days, from n days to n+1 days
#     n weeks to n+1 weeks      number of weeks, from n weeks to n+1 weeks
#     n months to n+1 months    number of months, from n months to n+1 months
#     n years to n+1 years      number of years, from n years to n+1 years
#
# examples:

#     artist        a% to c%
#     leastplayed   first 100 records
#     inserted      last 30 days
#     inserted      31 days to 90 days
