SONOSPY GUI READ ME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to get wxPython 3.0 in order to run the GUI 
(http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, everything has a tool tip associated with it for some attempts 
at clarity.

Preferences are stored in gui/GUIpref.ini and can be manually edited or 
can be saved within the app on each specific tab using the SAVE DEFAULTS 
button.

You can run this by ./sonsopyGUI.py (Linux) or python sonospyGUI.py 
(Linux/Windows).  Databases created here are still stored where scan, etc. 
uses them.  If you have Windows setup right, you can double clicke on the
sonospyGUI.py file in your root sonospy folder.

[LAUNCH TAB]
 - Will launch and stop Sonospy.
 - AUTO POPULATE will search for databases (extensions can be set in 
   GUIpref.ini) and will autopopulate the databases and proxy names for you.

[SCAN TAB]
 - SCAN and REPAIR both log to the log window, but it comes through 
   chunk at a time.  Not quite in realtime, but close enough.

[EXTRACT TAB]
 - Last <X> Albums is experimental, it gets the job done, but it's not 
   perfect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Loading virtuals only works with one "set".  If you store more than one 
   virtual/work in an .SP file, it won't work.  Best to use the SP files 
   created with the GUI until I find a solution here in terms of GUI layout.
 - There are a number of asserts that fire off on scan and repair.  I think
   it is related to the multithreading, but I am having a tough time debugging
   it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GENERAL]
 - Look at the PIP installer.  Py2Exe?
 - Setup a taskbar for starting, stopping sonospy.
 - Find out how to store comments in the GUIpref.ini
 - Debug wxPython 3.0 implementation (Hi Bart!) 
 - Fix onClose in sonospyGUI.py to support killing the proces in Windows.
 
[USERINDEX.INI]
 - Consider a tab to allow for generation of a userindex.ini file.

[EXTRACT]
 - Figure out how to get the combo box to be a multi-select box.

[VIRTUALS]
 - How to handle multiple SPs in one File? Do I bother?
 - Implement an ignoreChar list to manage lines to ignore based on line[0]

             Added popup to warn user if they have more than one database
