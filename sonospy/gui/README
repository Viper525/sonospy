SONOSPY GUI READ ME
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to get wxPython 2.8 in order to run the GUI (http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE / KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, everything has a tool tip associated with it for some attempts at clarity.

Preferences are stored in gui/GUIpref.ini and can be manually edited or can be saved within
the app on each specific tab using the SAVE DEFAULTS button.

You can run this by ./sonsopyGUI.py (linux) or python sonospyGUI.py (linux/windows).  Databases created here are still stored where scan, etc. uses them.

[LAUNCH TAB]
 - Will launch and stop Sonospy.
 - AUTO POPULATE will search for databases (extensions can be set in GUIpref.ini) and will autopopulate the databases and proxy names for you.

[SCAN TAB]
 - SCAN and REPAIR both log to the log window, but it comes through chunk at a time.  Not quite in realtime, but close enough.

[VIRTUALS]
 - Loading virtuals only works with one "set".  If you store more than one virtual/work in an .SP file, it won't work.  Best to use the SP files created with the GUI until I find a solution here in terms of GUI layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GENERAL]
 - Look at installers for entire sonospy project (not just GUI)
 - Minimize to tray?
