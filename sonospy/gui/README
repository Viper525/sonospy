SONOSPY GUI READ ME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to get wxPython 3.0 in order to run the GUI (http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, everything has a tool tip associated with it for some attempts 
at clarity.

Preferences are stored in gui/GUIpref.ini and can be manually edited or 
can be saved within the app on each specific tab using the SAVE DEFAULTS 
button.

You can run this by ./sonospyGUI.py (Linux) or python sonospyGUI.py 
(Linux/Windows).  Databases created here are still stored where scan, etc. 
uses them.  If you have Windows setup right, you can double clicke on the
sonospyGUI.py file in your root sonospy folder.

[LAUNCH TAB]
 - Will launch and stop Sonospy.
 - AUTO POPULATE will search for databases (extensions can be set in 
   GUIpref.ini) and will autopopulate the databases and proxy names for you.

[SCAN TAB]
 - SCAN and REPAIR both log to the log window, but it comes through 
   chunk at a time.  Not quite in realtime, but close enough.

[EXTRACT TAB]
 - Last <X> Albums is experimental, it gets the job done, but it's not 
   perfect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Loading virtuals only works with one "set".  If you store more than one 
   virtual/work in an .SP file, it won't work.  Best to use the SP files 
   created with the GUI until I find a solution here in terms of GUI layout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GENERAL]
 - Look at the PIP installer.  Py2Exe?
 - Find out how to store comments in the GUIpref.ini
 - Detect if windowsPID is running already and setup the GUI to reflect
   the current state of Sonospy
 - Add ABOUT tab.
 - Fix the multiple options windows opening if you use File -> Preferences.

[LAUNCH]

[SCAN]

[USERINDEX]
 - Consider a tab to allow for generation of a userindex.ini file.

[VIRTUALS]
 - How to handle multiple SPs in one file? Do I bother?
 - Implement an ignoreChar list to manage lines to ignore based on line[0]

CHANGELIST
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May-25-2014: Default extension if none is given for database entries
             
May-24-2014: Added Advanced field to Extract Tab to allow for custom SQL queries.
             Added menu items for exiting and stopping Sonospy to the system tray
             icon.  Not sure how to do this for starting the service, since you
             could, in thoery, launch it without any arguments from the launchTab.
             Added a wx.Yield() command to the WorkerThread in scan and extract to
             hopefully eliminate the assert issues.
May-21-2014: Updated for wxPython 3.0 -- please email any weirdness in the 
             application to chowanec@gmail.com
             Added systray icon for minimizing the app.  Restores the app
             on a double click.
May-19-2014: Added application icons for the GUI.  Welcome to 2014.
May-17-2014: Saving the windows position, size, location and maximize()
             on close of the application.  Saves settings in GUIpref.ini
             for use on reloading the app.
             Added a STOP command for Windows after much, much, much
             research.
May-16-2014: Added -z Support and field to allow for binding to a service
             for SMAPI support
             Scanned sonospy/ for *.ini to create a dropdown for user based
             ini files.  Ignores pycpoint.ini and scan.ini
             Fixed a longstanding bug with the scan field that Bart found. :)
May-15-2014: Fixed bug with extractTab where it was not combining AND
             statements properly.
             Added popup to warn user if they have more than one database
             in their launchCMD, that they have to have the requisite number
             of ports open.
May-10-2014: Added SMAPI Support
             Added fields to launchTab for user index ini files.
             Added checkbox to enable/disable SMAPI support
Feb-12-2012: Added support for -s flag
